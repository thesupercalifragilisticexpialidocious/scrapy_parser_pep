# PEP parsing

This is a Scrapy project for parsing Python enhancment proposals. It produces a csv table detailing a status for each PEP. Another generated table is a breakdown of PEP total number by statuses.

To run the spider, install Scrapy and dependencies in a virtual environment `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then launch `scrapy crawl pep`
